# hello-world
=============

Dangit!

I'm Dan Rodda & I draw stuff occasionally.
I got a degree as an Illustrator, then I got a job as a production artist.
I want to exercise my left brain and learn to build some stuff. I want to learn a little front end web design.
I would be great to learn some rudimentary interactive animation and game programming too. I used to dabble in game design.

Peace, for now.
